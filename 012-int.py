# First version

# Enter two strings
x = input("What's x? ")
y = input("What's y? ")

# Calculate sum of of two integers converted from strings
z = int(x) + int(y)

# Show result
print(z)

# Second version

# Enter two integer strings and convert them into integers
x = int(input("What's x? "))
y = int(input("What's y? "))

# Calculate sum of them and show result
print(x + y)

# Third version

# Enter two strings, convert them into integers, sum them and show the result
print(int(input("What's x? ")) + int(input("What's y? ")))
